# Stroke-prediction-based-on-patient-data
School project where I compare how three different classification methods (Random forest, SVM, KNN) predicts risk of stroke from patient data. The data set can be found from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset. More information about the project can be found from the project report.
